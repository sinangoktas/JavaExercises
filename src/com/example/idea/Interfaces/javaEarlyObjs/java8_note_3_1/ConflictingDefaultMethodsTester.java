  This class demonstrates what happens when a class inherits a method
  that conflicts with a default method from an interface. 

  The User class inherits the name method from its superclass Person,
  AND it inherits a default name method from the Named interface.
  Which one is called when you invoke it? Because of the "classes win"
  rule, it is the one that is inherited from the superclass.
